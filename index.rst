CyVerse Learning Institute - Foundations of Open Science Skills (FOSS) Camp 2019
------------------------------------



**Who Should Attend**
<<<<<<< HEAD

 - Prior to the workshop, please take the `Pre-workshop Survey <link>`_.

=======
Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) is a novel, camp-style training designed to prepare principal investigators and their lab teams, both new and established, to meet the growing expectations of funding agencies, publishers, and research institutions for scientific reproducibility and data accessibility.

**Workshop Level**
There are no pre-requisites for FOSS, but the course will cover a lot of material in a short time. Participants who have limited computational experience should try to view the Software Carpentry Core Lessons (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) before attending.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

- How to containerize applications and workflows
- How to use other containerized applications and workflows
- How to build/deploy containerized applications and workflows
- How to scale out your computation from laptop to cloud to HPC/OSG

About CyVerse
-------------

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.

**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.

While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.
