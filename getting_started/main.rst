**Getting Started**
==========

FOSS will take place in Bioscience Research Lab. This is a restricted entry building. Please assemble in the lobby of the building, near the elevators, at 8:45 on the first morning.

This workshop runs under a `Code of Conduct <../getting_started/code_of_conduct.html>`_. Please respect it and be excellent to each other!

**Learning objectives**

Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) is a novel, camp-style training designed to prepare principal investigators and their lab teams, both new and established, to meet the growing expectations of funding agencies, publishers, and research institutions for scientific reproducibility and data accessibility.

The workshop will cover key concepts about open science:
- Collaboration culture
- Software essentials
- Using CyVerse cyberinfrastructure
- Data management
- Cloud computing

**FOSS Camp Goes Green**

We encourage all FOSS Camp participants to help minimize our waste footprint. If possible, bring your own reusable beverage containers, such as coffee mugs and water bottles, to use during snack breaks. Public transportation from the venue to the 4th Ave. and Downtown districts is easy with Tuscson's modern street car. TuGo bike rentals are available outside the building. Thanks in advance!

**Who should attend?**

The content of this workshop is targeted at new investigators who want to set up a lab following open science principles. However, experienced researchers who want to bring new ideas to their labs are welcome, as are post-docs who expect to be setting up a lab in the near future.

**Workshop level**

This workshop is focused on researchers little to moderate experience in open science skills.
