Communication
-------------

Choosing which software to use for your lab's primary digital communication can be complicated by the sheer number of platforms that are out there.

For this workshop, we are going to cover a popular platform with free/paid access, `SLACK <https://slack.com/>`_ (Searchable Log of All Conversation & Knowledge), and `Gitter <https://gitter.im/home>`_  

Remember, the intention of these platforms are to __improve productivity__ not become a distraction
