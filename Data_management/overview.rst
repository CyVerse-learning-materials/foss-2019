**Data Management Overview**
----------------------

.. #### Comment: Introduction to basic data management principles

Why should you care about data management?
============================

If you give your data to a colleague who has not been involved with your project, will they be able to make sense of it? Will they be able to use it effectively and properly?

If you come back to your own data in five years, will you be able to make sense of it? Will you be able to use it effectively and properly?

When you are ready to publish a paper, is it easy to find all the correct versions of all the data you used and present them in a comprehensible manner?

Data management produces self-describing datasets that:
- make life much easier for you and your collaborators
- benefit the scientific research community by allowing others to reuse your data
- are required by most funders and many journals

Data Management Basics
===================

**The Data Life Cycle**

**Data management** is the set of practices that allow researchers to effectively and efficiently handle data throughout the data life cycle. Although typically shown as a circle (below) the actually life cycle of any data item may follow a different path, with branches and internal loops. Being aware of your data's future helps you plan how to best manage them.

**Data Types**
==========

Different types of data require different management practices. What are some of the condiserations for managing:
- tabular data
- images
- sound or video recordings
- geospatial data
- sensor data
- raw versus processed data
- files versus datasets
